# Problem 1

## Read and clean the data
```{r}
transit_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
transit_data
```

This dataset contains such variables: "line", "station name", "station latitude", "stantion longitude", "route1" to "route11", "entry", "vending", "entrance type" and "ADA compliance".

My data cleaning step:

*   Import the dataset
*   Clean the names
*   Select the variables I'm interested in 
*   Use the ifelse function to convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable

This dataset contains `r nrow(transit_data)` rows and `r ncol(transit_data)` columns. And these data are not tidy.

## Question 1
How many distinct stations are there? 
```{r}
distinct_stations = distinct(transit_data, station_name, line, .keep_all = T) 
nrow(distinct_stations)
```

## Question 2
How many stations are ADA compliant?
```{r}
distinct_stations %>% 
  filter(ada == T) %>% 
  nrow()
```

## Question 3
What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

If we only count the distinct stations, the propotion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is
```{r}
distinct_stations %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO", entry == "TRUE") %>% 
  nrow() / nrow(filter(transit_data, vending == "NO"))
```

If we count all of the stations (different entrances of station as difference stations), the propotion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is
```{r}
transit_data %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO", entry == "TRUE") %>% 
  nrow() / nrow(filter(transit_data, vending == "NO"))
```
